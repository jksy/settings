# Lynx user defaults file

# user_mode specifies the users level of knowledge with Lynx.
# The default is NOVICE which displays two extra lines of help at the
# bottom of the screen to aid the user in learning the basic Lynx
# commands.  Set user_mode to INTERMEDIATE to turn off the extra info.
# Use ADVANCED to see the URL of the currently selected link at the
# bottom of the screen
#
# NOTE TO BLIND USERS: setting Lynx to ADVANCED user_mode is one means of
# ascertaining where an ALT-textless link leads
user_mode=ADVANCED

# file editor specifies the editor to be invoked when editing Lynx files.
# if no editor is specified then file editing is disabled unless it
# is activated from the command line
#
# NOTE TO BLIND USERS: specifying an editor is extremely helpful when
# using mailto: links or sending a comment via the 'c' command.  a
# speech-friendly guide to using Lynx's default line editor can be found
# at http://leb.net/blinux/blynx/edit_help.html

# logging purposes, and for mailed comments.

# if case sensitive searching is on then when the user invokes a search

# the default is usually off

# The file sort method specifies which value to sort on when viewing file
# lists such as FTP directories.  The options are:

# The character set definition controls the representation of
# 8 bit characters for your terminal.  If 8 bit characters do
# not show up correctly on your screen you may try changing
# to a different 8 bit set or using the 7 bit character approximations.
# Current valid characters sets are:
#    ISO Latin 1
#    ISO Latin 2
#    Other ISO Latin
#    DEC Multinational
#    IBM PC character set
#    IBM PC codepage 850

# if VI keys are turned on then the normal VI movement keys:

# If sub_bookmarks are turned on then all bookmark operations
# will first prompt the user to select an active sub-bookmark file.
# If the default lynx bookmarks file is defined, it will be used as
# the default selection. When this option is set to 'advanced', and
# the user mode is advanced, the 'v'iew bookmark command will invoke
# a statusline prompt instead of the menu seen in novice and intermediate
# user modes. When this option is set to 'standard', the menu will be
# presented regardless of user mode. If this option is set to 'off',
# sub-bookmark files are disabled.

# if keypad_mode is set to NUMBERS_AS_ARROWS then the numbers

# linedit_mode specifies the key binding used for inputting strings in

# preferred_language specifies the language in MIME notation (e.g., en,
# fr) which Lynx will indicate you prefer in requests to http servers.
# If a file in that language is available, the server will send it.
# Otherwise, the server will send the file in it's default language.
preferred_language=ja
#preferred_language=en

# preferred_charset specifies the character set in MIME notation (e.g.,
# ISO-8859-2, ISO-8859-5) which Lynx will indicate you prefer in requests
# to http servers using an Accept-Charset header.  The value should NOT
# include ISO-8859-1 or US-ASCII, since those values are always assumed by
# default.  If a file in that character set is available, the server will
# send it.  Otherwise, the server will send the file in ISO-8859-1 or
# US-ASCII.
preferred_charset=

# show_dotfiles specifies that the directory listing should include
# "hidden" (dot) files/directories.  If set "on", this will be
# honored only if enabled via userdefs.h and/or lynx.cfg, and not
# restricted via a command line switch.  If display of hidden files
# is disabled, creation of such files via Lynx also is disabled.
show_dotfiles=off

# dir_list_styles specifies the directory list style under DIRED_SUPPORT
# (if implemented).  The default is MIXED_STYLE, which sorts both files and
# directories together.  FILES_FIRST lists files first and DIRECTORIES_FIRST
# lists directories first.

# select_popups specifies whether the OPTIONs in a SELECT block which
# lacks a MULTIPLE attribute are presented as a vertical list of radio
# buttons or via a popup menu.  Note that if the MULTIPLE attribute is
# present in the SELECT start tag, Lynx always will create a vertical list
# of checkboxes for the OPTIONs.  A value of "on" will set popup menus
# as the default while a value of "off" will set use of radio boxes.
# The default can be overridden via the -popup command line toggle.
#
# NOTE TO BLIND USERS: leave this value set to "off" to have Lynx
# automatically convert pop-up select option boxes into radio boxes.
